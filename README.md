# Laundary Management
Laundry Management is an application designed to streamline laundry operations and management, providing specific functionalities for efficient laundry management.

For this project, we've established two distinct repositories, one dedicated to the backend and another for the frontend. This separation allows for improved organization and streamlined maintenance.

## Prerequisites
- Gradle 8.2.1
- Java v17.0.8
- NodeJS  v18.17.1
- NPM v9.6.7


## Languages codes
### Backend
Respository: [Backend](https://github.com/rdpetrelv/TestBackend)
- Java (Spring Boot framework)
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

### Frontend
Repository: [Frontend](https://github.com/FatiGhaoui/LaundaryManagementFrontEnd.git)
- Vue
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Shell

## Installation
Currently, there isn't a specific installation method available as the application is under active development. However, you can clone the repository from GitHub or download the source code and run it locally on your machine.

### Backend
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdpetrelv/TestBackend
cd TestBackend
./gradlew build
```
There is no need to download or install our backend, because it is hosted at clevercloud:
**[https://laundryapp.cleverapps.io/](https://laundryapp.cleverapps.io/swagger-ui/index.html).**

You can log in using the credentials:
```
user
myPassword
````


### Frontend
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FatiGhaoui/LaundaryManagementFrontEnd.git
cd LaundaryManagementFrontEnd
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Usage
Once you have successfully set up the development environment, you can access the Laundary Management application through the following URL:
#### [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

- ###  Machines Page
On this page you can view the status (available or not) of the machine as well as its progress in real time.

- ###  Sensors Page

- ###  Reservations Page
This page is the one that interacts the most with the user, allowing him to create, modify and delete reservations. Likewise, if there is an error, it will be displayed on the screen.This page is the one that interacts the most with the user, allowing him to create, modify and delete reservations.
